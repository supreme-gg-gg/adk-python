# ADK Skills Demo

This example demonstrates the recommended best practice for integrating filesystem-based skills with an ADK agent.

## Architecture

This demo uses a simple and powerful shell-based architecture:

1.  **`SkillsPlugin`**: This plugin is added to the `App` definition. It automatically provides the agent with a `SkillsShellTool`.
2.  **`SkillsShellTool`**: A sandboxed shell that allows the agent to `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, and `python` within the `examples/skills/` directory.
3.  **System Prompt**: A comprehensive system prompt in `agent.py` (generated by `generate_shell_skills_system_prompt`) teaches the agent how to use the shell to discover, read, and execute skills following a progressive disclosure pattern.

## Available Skills

The agent has access to the skills defined in `examples/skills/`:

- **`pdf-processing`**: For extracting text from PDFs, merging documents, etc.
- **`data-analysis`**: For running data quality checks and other analysis.
- **`analyzing-financial-statements`**: For calculating key financial ratios from financial statements. this is sourced from Claude's [skills cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks/tree/main/skills)

## How to Run the Demo

Simply run the `run.py` script from this directory:

```bash
python run.py
```

You can then have an interactive chat session with the agent.

### Example Questions

- "What skills do you have?"
- "I need to analyze a CSV file, what should I do first?"
- "How can I extract text from a PDF document?"
- "Can you help me analyze financial statements?" + attach relevant financial data files.
- "Perform data quality checks on this dataset." + attach a CSV file.
